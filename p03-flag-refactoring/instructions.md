## Description

In this at-home project, weâ€™ll be refactoring Guess the Flag, one of our old projects from 100 Days, to use an ObservableObject and use a more MVVM-like project structure.

Iâ€™ve provided a cleaned-up version of my implementation (originally from June 2020 ðŸ¤¯) that you can use as starter code. You can also replace my project with your old implementation if youâ€™d like.

## What Does Success Look Like?

- Because weâ€™re just cleaning up code, a user shouldnâ€™t notice that the code changed
- You should refactor all of your View code to be pretty simple
    - Present the data provided by the View Model
    - Handle button pressed and call methods in the View Model accordingly

## Goal

- Start to get comfortable with MVVM and ObservableObject
- Get aquatinted with the concept of refactoring code
