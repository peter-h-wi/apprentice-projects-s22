## What Does Success Look Like?

- Create at least one `@State` variable
- Use `Button` to create plus and minus buttons that change counter variable
- Use `Text` to display the current count (updates when changed, obviously)
- Prevent user from having a negative count
- (Optional Easy) Change button appearance to indicate that it cannot be pressed
    - Minus button should change when count is zero
- (Optional Harder) Add concept of a limit and make UI change when limit is surpassed

## Goal

- Review basic SwiftUI state management
- Review very fundamental SwiftUI layout

## Installation and Setup Instructions

No real installation instructions for this one, just make your own Xcode project and get to coding!!
